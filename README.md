# Assignment-2-Reflection

## What I learned

I learned that blogging and creating a website is actually easier than expected. It allows you to reach out to other people and ytalk about something you actually care about. I had fun talking about something I care about. 

## What still confuses me

What still confuses me concerning the blog assignment is the exact specifications required. I agree that a tool such as wordpress should be used and proper grammar and resources should be utilized. I would have preferred more freedom for blog set up, length of posts, and the way we choose to navigate. 

For instance I created a specific tab for each blog post, instead of one tab with "blogs" where they all are located. I felt it was more offical looking and easier to navigate for reading my blogs. Having a tab for each blog makes it easier to find and I feel like it puts more focus on the blogs, rather than one tab where you can scroll and view all the blogs at once.
